# Color Match Puzzle Prototype

This project is a **playable puzzle prototype** developed in Unity, centered around placing colored blocks into their correct positions by matching **both color and shape**.

## About
The core goal of the game is for the player to arrange the given colored blocks so that they **exactly match the target areas** in terms of color and shape.

Each level presents a puzzle that appears simple at first glance, but requires attention and correct placement decisions to solve.

Difficulty increases as block combinations become more complex, even when colors are shared across different shapes.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- Blocks are defined by both color and shape
- Target areas provide clear visual guidance for correct placement
- Progress is only possible when **both color and shape match**
- Incorrect placements provide immediate visual feedback
- Puzzle complexity increases gradually with each level

## Key Highlights
- Color and shape matching puzzle mechanic
- Clean and minimal user interface
- Intuitive, easy-to-learn gameplay
- Level-based progression
- Simple and refactor-friendly code structure suitable for prototyping

## Purpose
This project was created to:
- explore color-based puzzle mechanics,
- quickly prototype a clear and readable gameplay idea,
- and deliver a small-scale but focused player experience.

It is not intended as a commercial product, but as a solid prototype that can be expanded with additional mechanics or level variations.

In short, this project demonstrates  
**how a color and shape matching concept can be turned into a playable puzzle prototype in a short development time.**
